Building a solid-state (singing) Tesla coil is a pretty complicated undertaking, and this is a tool
to help guide one in the construction of such a device.  At each step the parameters you pick will be
graphically compared with other confirmed working Tesla coil designs so that choiced can be made to fall 
within (or outside of!) the known engineering envelope.

<template name="stepSecondary">
  Lets start with the approximate size of the secondary coil which you wish to build:
  <ol>
	  <li><input type="text" name="height"> cm</li>
	  <li><input type="text" name="width"> cm</li>
  </ol>
  Reccomend an aspect ration (H/R) from 3-7

  Next lets figure out how much wire is going on this thing:
  <ol>
  	<li>Drop Down with Wire Gauges <input type="text" name="gauge"></li>
  	<li>Packing Factor <input type="text" name="factor"> %</li>
  </ol>

  Alright, that gives us a ballpark estimate of the secondary coil's inductance:

<template name="stepTwo">
  Now that we have an estimate of your secondary coil's inductance, we need to make some
  electrical decisions.  Next we can pick the resonance frequency of your coil.

  This quantity is given by
  {{#mathjax}}
    $$f = /frac{1}{2 /pi /sqrt(LC)}
  {{/mathjax}}

  The typical range of resonance frequencies is ~30kHz - 200kHz.  
	<!-- Pro/Con of different freq selections -->

  Lower resonance frequencies require less speedy switching circuits (cheaper) but typically
  a larger capacitor bank size.  

  High frequency typically have better "spin-up" time, but have more stringent requirements on 
  switching speed of the driving circuitry.  

  <!-- Plot secondary size vs resonance freq -->
  <!-- Plot of secondary L vs resonance freq -->
